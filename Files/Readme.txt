Uploaded files will be stored in this folder. If you wish to change it you 
can do so in the web.config by changing the filePath attribute of the 
siteSettings element, for example:

<siteSettings filePath="/Here/Are/My/Files/" />

Make sure that the folder ends with a slash and that the folder path exists 
with the proper access rights (no folders will be created by the system).
